Classes:

Created Abstract Class [Person]
Created template class Queue
Which contains Virtual Print Info
  Class consists of Name Age & ID
  
  Person is inherited to Class [Mechanic & Customer]
    
    To create a mechanic you would need Name ID and age while Customer would only take Name and age
  
   Struct Appointment which consists of Hours and Minutes.
   
   We have 5 mechanics and 30 customers each with different names and ids[Mechanic]
   
   
   
   In int main:
   
   we sort the appoinments [using the overloaded operands and buble sorting in the main itself]
   to which was first then send it to a for loop to be set into the mechanic if he is available
   
   all input is taken from files for the Mechanic and Customer respectfully
   and each step is documented in the ouput and saved in a seperate file "ListOfAppointments.txt"
